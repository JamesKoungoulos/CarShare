--------------------CODEBASE CHANGES--------------------
database.py
+ added commented-in dictionary for different error codes
+ implemented all of the functions  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
+ altered return value of make_booking so that more granular failure messages can be delivered to the front end

routes.py
+ manually assigned email from returned list in login() so that nicknames may be used instead (i.e. user_details['email'] = val[9])
+ added check in login() for null homebay columns, entering default string 'Add a homebay' if so
+ added catch for the 'Add a homebay' value mentioned earlier in list_bays() in order to just load the bay list normally when given by index
+ added functionality for when a search returns no bays in list_bays() - now has special flash message 'No results found' and filler list entry with the same message
+ updated session value for homebay in homebay() after successful update
+ incremented session value for bookings made after successfull booking in new_booking()
+ altered control structure for return value delivered in new_booking() so that different success/failure/error messages may be shown 

frat.py & frat.html
+ 'theoretically' functional (as in not at all) code for the FRAT extension, unfinished because we did Option 3 anyway 

bay_list.html
+ altered the hotlink to each bay in the list so that it doesn't escape any '&' characters in the bay names

bay_detail
+ added a column for each car listed to display immediate availability 

booking_detail.html
+ added a field displaying base estimates for the booking in question

login.html
+ changed placehold text for username field to "Enter your Email or Nickname" to better reflect its functionality

+ changed list for duration to remove the option of selecting 0 hours
